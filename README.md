# Voting DApp

## Overview
voting-dapp is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to vote securely on a blockchain network. This project is built using Solidity for smart contracts and integrates with a web-based frontend for user interaction.

## Features
- Smart contract-based voting system
- Secure and tamper-proof votes
- Web3 integration for interacting with the blockchain
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js
- **Development Environment:** Hardhat/Truffle

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (for interacting with the blockchain)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dappteacher/voting-dapp.git
   cd voting-dapp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
4. Test the smart contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat test
   ```   
5. Deploy the contracts on Sepolia and replace the values based on "Configuration":
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### **Configuration**
Before running the application, update the contract address and Infura endpoint in the appropriate files:

1. **Smart Contract Address:**  
   Replace your deployed contract address in the frontend config (e.g., `src/App.js` and `.env` file):
   ```js
   const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
   ```

2. **Infura Endpoint:**  
   Update the Infura API URL in your environment file (`.env`):
   ```
   INFURA_API_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
   ```

**Note:** Replace `"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"` and `"YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"` with your own values.

## Usage
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Select or add a voting option.
3. Submit your vote securely on the blockchain.
4. View the live vote count.
